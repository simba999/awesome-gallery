            As the price of installing solar has gotten less expensive, more
            homeowners are turning to it as a possible option for decreasing
            their energy bill. We want to make installing solar panels easy
            and understandable for anyone.

            When you enter your address, Project Sunroof looks up your home in
            Google Maps and combines that information with other databases to
            create your personalized roof analysis. Don�t worry, Project
            Sunroof doesn't give the address to anybody else unless you ask it
            to.

      <li>Google's database of aerial imagery and maps</li>
      <li>3D modeling of your roof</li>

      Project Sunroof recommends an installation size to generate close
      to 100% of your electricity use, based on roof size, the amount of
      sun hitting the roof, and your electricity bill.
    </p>
    <p class="md-body">
      We recommend an installation that covers less than 100% of your
      electrical usage because, in most areas, there is little financial
      benefit to producing more power than you can consume.
